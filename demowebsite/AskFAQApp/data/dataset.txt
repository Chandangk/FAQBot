167	Why are Singapore Airlines and SilkAir folding fuel and insurance surcharges into base airfares?	Since 2008, we have already been showing the full price payable, inclusive of taxes and surcharges in our airfare advertising. The intention of removing fuel and insurance surcharges as a separate component and incorporating them into a single base airfare is to provide you with a more simplified fare structure. Taxes and charges levied by airport/government authorities will continue to be listed separately on your ticket.	0
168	From which date onwards will I no longer see a separate fuel and insurance surcharge component for my ticket purchases?	The folding in of fuel and insurance surcharges into the base airfares on Singapore Airlines and SilkAir flights will take place progressively from 28 March 2017.	0
169	How will I know if fuel and insurance surcharges are still charged as a separate component in my Singapore Airlines and/or SilkAir ticket?	Fuel and insurance surcharges are denoted by the “YQ” code, as reflected in the “Payment Details” section of your e-ticket. Once the fuel and insurance surcharges have been incorporated into the base airfare, the e-ticket receipt will either:     (i) Not include the “YQ” tax code under “Taxes”, OR     (ii) ”$0.00” will be shown beside the “YQ” code If you are purchasing your tickets via singaporeair.com or silkair.com, you will no longer see “Airline Insurance (YQAD)” and “Airline Fuel Surcharge (YQAC)” listed under the cost breakdown for airport and government taxes.	0
170	How does this folding-in affect the ticket prices that I will be paying?	There will be no immediate change to the total airfare payable as a direct consequence from the folding in of fuel and insurance surcharges into a single base airfare when you purchase your tickets with us. Taxes and charges levied by airport/government authorities will continue to be listed separately on your ticket. Any change to the all-in fares would be due solely to seasonal review in pricing, based on prevailing market supply and demand conditions, and fluctuation in currency exchange rates.	0

173	Why am I still seeing fuel and insurance surcharge as a separate component on my e-ticket receipts?	It could be due to one of the following reasons:      (i) Your travel itinerary include other airlines’ flight numbers, where fuel and/or insurance surcharge may still be applicable depending on other airlines’ policy; or      (ii) Your ticket was partially flown/utilised and was re-issued, from an original ticket which had fuel and insurance surcharges (“YQ”) listed as a separate component from the base airfare; or      (iii) Your ticket was issued/re-issued before the cutover date.	0
174	Can I ask for a refund of the fuel and insurance surcharges that I have paid?	There is no change in the total airfare payable, as a result of the folding in of fuel and insurance surcharges in the base airfare. We do not refund the base airfare or the fuel surcharges separately from each other. If you would like to refund your entire ticket, it would be subjected to eligibility conditions and applicable fees.	0
175	The ticket I purchased has fuel and insurance surcharges listed as a separate component of the base airfare. If I need to make changes to my itinerary, will I still be charged fuel and insurance surcharges?	If you have not flown on any of the travel sectors on your ticket itinerary and would like to make changes to your itinerary, fuel and insurance surcharges will no longer reflect as a separate component of your air ticket. You will however see a higher base airfare on your new ticket as the surcharges are now folded in.
